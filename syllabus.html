                  <p>Robotics 102 will have a flipped classroom hybrid format this Fall semester.  
                    After the first week of the course, all lectures will be pre-recorded and available online through this course website.
                    In-person course lecture meetings will be used for brief (but required) course activities, optional question-and-answer discussions, and additional office hours for interactive help with course projects.
                    There will also be occasional field trips to see interesting robots.
                    In-person lab sections will be dedicated to topics for course projects, primarily for coding and robot projects. 
                    Students seeking help during office hours must watch all lectures that have been assigned up to the current date.
                    Everyone in Robotics 102 must comply with public health

                  <p>Robotics 102 is a robotics-friendly pathway into the computing disciplines and engineering more broadly.  
                    Robotics 102 is about learning computer programming in a manner that provides the foundation for understanding artificial intelligence and its computational foundations.
                    The course uses the application of autonomous robot navigation for students to think through problems computational using graphs and graph algorithms  
                    Similar in aims to Engineering 101, Robotics 102 prepare students for further courses in computer science, such as Data Structures (EECS 280), and computing across engineering disciplines.
                    This course also provides introductory coverage of topics in artificial intelligence such that students understand the major approaches to AI and how AI methods function.
                    In complement with Robotics 101 (Computational Linear Algebra), this introductory exposure to builds into further study of Robotics and AI by undergraduates, including those for mobile robotics, robot perception, autonomous robotics, computer vision, and machine learning.
                    Fall 2021 is the first offering of Robotics 102 as a pilot that is part of the emerging Michigan Robotics Undergraduate Program.

                  We ask that all students to treat each other with respect.  As indicated in the
                  <a href="http://www.engin.umich.edu/college/academics/bulletin/rules#generalstandardsofconductforengineeringstudents">General Standards of Conduct for Engineering Students</a>,
                  this course is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for all persons and does not discriminate
                  on the basis of race, color, national origin, age, marital status, sex, sexual orientation, gender
                  identity, gender expression, disability, religion, height, weight, or veteran status. Please feel
                  free to contact the course staff with any problem, concern, or suggestion. The University of Michigan
                  <a href="https://oscr.umich.edu/statement">Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities</a>

                  <h3>Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</h3>

                  <p>
                  If you believe an accommodation is needed for a disability, please let the course instructor know at
                  your earliest convenience. Some aspects of this course, including the assignments, the in-class
                  activities, and the way the course is usually taught, may be modified to facilitate your participation
                  and progress. As soon as you make us aware of your needs, the course staff can work with the
                  <a href="http://ssd.umich.edu">Services for Students with Disabilities</a> (SSD, 734-763-3000) office
                  to help us determine appropriate academic accommodations. SSD typically recommends accommodations
                  through a Verified Individualized Services and Accommodations (VISA) form. Any information you provide
                  is private and confidential and will be treated as such. For special accommodations for any academic
                  evaluation (exam, quiz, project), the course staff will need to receive the necessary paperwork issued
                  from the SSD office by <i>September TODO, 2021</i>.
